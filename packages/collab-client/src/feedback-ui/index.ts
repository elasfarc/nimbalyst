 * measured, and which it blew straight past (35 KB ceiling, 58.8 KB actual)
 * the first time it was exported normally.
 *
 * Nothing outside this package needs the component: a host supplies
 * `renderArtifactDetail` and the ask field mounts the popover lazily, on the
 * click that opens it. These are the types that crossing that seam requires.
