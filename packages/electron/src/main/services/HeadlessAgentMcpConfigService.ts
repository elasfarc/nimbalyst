/**
 * Writes Nimbalyst's enabled MCP servers into the config file Cursor Agent
 * reads.
 *
 * `cursor-agent` accepts no inline server list, so it must be told through
 * `.cursor/mcp.json` (workspace) or `~/.cursor/mcp.json` — a file the user also
 * owns. Every ACP provider, Grok Build included, hands `mcpServers` to
 * `session/new` instead and leaves no trace on disk.
 *
 * Grok deliberately has no target here. It used to get `~/.grok/mcp.json`, back
 * when it ran as `grok -p`. That file is written mode 0644 and holds the
 * *resolved* server map — real `DISCORD_TOKEN` and `POSTHOG_PERSONAL_API_KEY`
 * values, not placeholders — so once ACP delivery made it redundant it was pure
 * credential exposure. Do not add a target back without an inline-delivery
 * reason; there isn't one for any ACP agent.
 *
 * Ownership of the file we do write is the whole design constraint here:
 *
 * - Only the `nimbalyst:`-prefixed keys are ever written or removed. A server
 *   the user added by hand, or that another tool added, is left exactly as it
 *   was — including on a full sync that removes stale Nimbalyst entries.
 * - The file is only rewritten when the resulting content differs, so enabling
 *   a session does not churn a file the user may have open.
 * - A malformed existing file is left alone rather than replaced. Overwriting
 *   it would destroy configuration we cannot read but the user can.
