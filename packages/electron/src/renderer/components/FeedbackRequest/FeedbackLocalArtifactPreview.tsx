/**
 * An artifact that is still a file on this machine, painted with its real
 * editor.
 *
 * Every other preview path in this feature resolves a *published* document
 * through a collab room, and declines anything else. That was right for the
 * recipient -- publishing rewrites a `file` ref to a `document`, so a `file`
 * ref never reaches one -- and it quietly made two common cases render a grey
 * box with a letter in it:
 *
 * - **Compose.** The author reviewing their own draft is looking at artifacts
 *   that have not been published yet, by design: nothing leaves the machine
 *   until they approve it. Every artifact in a draft is a `file` ref, so the
 *   surface where you decide what to send was the one surface that could not
 *   show you what you were sending.
 * - **Asking yourself.** When the recipient can already see the resource,
 *   nothing is published, so the refs stay `file` on the delivered request too.
 *
 * Both are answered here, and neither needs collaboration: the file is on disk,
 * the extension that paints it is registered in this build, and the SDK already
 * ships a host for exactly this shape -- `createReadOnlyHost`, which serves
 * pre-loaded content with no IPC and no document id.
 *
 * Renderer-only. The no-dynamic-import rule covers the Electron main process.
