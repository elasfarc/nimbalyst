 * lookup something to match; the functions here decide when to offer it, what
 * the account row should say meanwhile, and what a chosen folder may be used
 * for.
 *
 * Kept free of IPC and React so both the main process (which owns the git and
 * filesystem facts) and the renderer (which owns the dialog) can share one set
 * of rules. See nimbalyst-local/plans/simpler-org-signup-flow.md.
