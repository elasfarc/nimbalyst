/**
 * Project Canvas surface: React Flow over a `CanvasDocument`.
 *
 * Host-agnostic on purpose -- nothing here reaches for Electron, the
 * filesystem, or a collab room, because Slice 6 publishes this same module to
 * the web console through `@nimbalyst/collab-bundle`. The document comes in as
 * a prop and every edit goes back out through `onDocumentChange`; the host
 * decides what a change means (mark dirty, save, push into a Y.Doc).
 *
 * Three decisions worth reading before changing anything here:
 *
 * **`zIndexMode="manual"` and groups are plain rank-ordered rectangles.** JSON
 * Canvas defines z-order as node array position and gives a `group` node no
 * containment semantics at all -- membership is purely geometric and children
 * keep absolute coordinates. Modelling groups as React Flow `parentId`
 * sub-flows would require `zIndexMode="auto"`, which forces every child above
 * its parent and makes the board paint in a different order than it saves; it
 * would also invent parent-relative coordinates the format does not have. So a
 * frame is just another node, its z-index is its position in rank order, and
 * `"manual"` hands that number to React Flow verbatim. The cost is that
 * "dragging a frame carries its contents" is our code rather than React Flow's
 * -- see `applyCanvasNodeChanges`.
 *
 * **`autoPanOnSelection` is off.** It defaults to `true` as of React Flow
 * 12.11. On a board where a rubber-band selection routinely runs to the edge of
 * the viewport, an automatic pan moves the cards out from under the box the
 * user is still drawing. It also collides with the activation model below,
 * which owns viewport animation. `autoPanOnNodeDrag` stays on: dragging a card
 * past the edge to move it further is what the user meant.
 *
 * **Activation is zoom-to-100** ([NIM-3845](nimbalyst://NIM-3845)).
 * *Double*-clicking a card animates the viewport to scale 1.0 centred on that
 * card and then activates it; when the viewport is already within 2% of 1.0 it
 * activates in place with no animation. Escape deactivates. Cards are
 * pointer-inert until activated -- see the header of CanvasCardNode for why
 * that is not optional.
 *
 * A single click only *selects*, and the split is not cosmetic: the resize
 * handles and the card toolbar are hidden while a card is active, because an
 * active card owns the pointer. When one click did both, every card on the
 * board was unresizable -- the handles appeared and vanished in the same frame.
 *
 * **Trackpad gestures follow the design-tool convention.** Two-finger drag
 * pans (`panOnScroll`), pinch zooms (React Flow reads the `ctrlKey` macOS
 * synthesises for a pinch), and Cmd/Ctrl + wheel zooms about the pointer. That
 * last one is ours: `createPanOnScrollHandler` only understands `ctrlKey`, and
 * its pinch branch multiplies the delta by ten, which is right for the tiny
 * deltas a pinch emits and wildly wrong for a scroll. See `onZoomWheel`.
 * `zoomOnDoubleClick` is off because double-click is now the activation
 * gesture, and a dblclick on a node bubbles to the pane.
 *
 * **The viewport is per-user view state and never enters the document.** Where
 * you are looking is not something a teammate should inherit: activation alone
 * moves the viewport on every card click, so writing it into the shared board
 * meant one person clicking a card yanked everyone else's saved view to theirs.
 * `meta.viewport` survives as the board's deliberate *home* view -- what the
 * "Save view" button writes, and what a converted `.mockupproject` carries over
 * -- while a user's own last position rides out through `onViewportChange` for
 * the host to keep locally. The channel for "where is Sam looking" is awareness,
 * which is a different thing again and belongs to Slice 4a.
 *
 * The React Flow attribution is left visible. Hiding it is a licensing choice
 * rather than a styling one, and it also trips a development warning as of
 * 12.11.4.

 * card. Folding that in would demote the entire board and unmount thirty
 * editors, and the user gets that for free every time they glance at a
 * transcript. The check is a synchronous read of the surface's own box inside
 * the callback rather than a flag set by the ResizeObserver, because the
 * ordering of the two observers is not specified and a flag can be one frame
 * stale in exactly the direction that hurts.
 *
 * **It reports hiddenness so the pure function can freeze.** See the header of
 * canvasCardLod for why freezing is the right answer rather than either
