 * ```ts
 * if (providerName !== 'openai-codex') return 'fuzzy';
 * const isOpenCodeEdit = OPENCODE_EDIT_TOOLS.includes(name) && session.provider === 'opencode';
 * const isCodexAcpEdit = CODEX_ACP_EDIT_TOOLS.includes(name) && session.provider === 'openai-codex-acp';
 * ```
 *
 * Both shapes grow one branch per provider, and both were already wrong in the
 * same way: `'disabled'` attribution reads as a Codex privilege when it is
 * simply what any provider earns by reporting authoritative structured file
 * changes. Adding a provider to `AI_PROVIDER_TYPES` now breaks these exhaustive
 * records until the provider says, in one place, what it can actually report.
