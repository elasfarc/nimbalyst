/**
 * Regression lock: closing a zombie index socket must not crash the host.
 *
 * `connectToIndex()` discards a socket that was created but never opened. The
 * `ws` package aborts a CONNECTING handshake ASYNCHRONOUSLY -- `close()` returns
 * normally and the failure arrives later as an `error` event. So the `try/catch`
 * around `close()` cannot catch it, and if the handler was detached first the
 * event has no listener and Node escalates it to an uncaught exception.
 *
 * On 2026-08-04 that killed the fork HOST every time the controller connected
 * (`Mobile device connected: M04 (Controller), syncing settings...` ->
 * `connectToIndex()` -> `Uncaught exception: WebSocket was closed before the
 * connection was established`), so controller approvals had nothing listening
 * on the other end.
