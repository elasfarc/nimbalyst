 * Keep the `@`-mention roster current for an open composer.
 *
 * The host's `getMembers` is a live read of team sync state, which hydrates
 * asynchronously. A composer that mounts before the roster lands would freeze
 * an empty snapshot for its whole lifetime, so every `@` reported "No matches
 * found" until the composer was closed and reopened.
 *
 * Re-reads while a mention query is open (`queryString` non-null) and returns
 * the PREVIOUS array whenever the roster is unchanged, so callers can keep
 * memoizing typeahead options on this value without the list re-identifying on
 * every keystroke. That referential stability is why the original code froze
 * the roster; it is preserved here without the staleness.
